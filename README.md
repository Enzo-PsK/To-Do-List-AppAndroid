# To-Do-List-AppAndroid

## About

I was awarded a scholarship by Santander for the DIO (Digital Innovation One) Android Developer Bootcamp.
The bootcamp lasted 107 hours, and the final project was basically an android mobile application that manages tasks to be done.  
The app starts with a landing page, indicating that no tasks were created. Click on the add button and add a new task to the list, where you can set title, date and time to your task (using datePicker and timePicker). When done, the task will appear in the list where you can edit or delete.  
It's a simple app, but the idea is to add new features gradually.
 
## Built with

* Kotlin
* Android Studio
